# Feature Engineering: Sentence & paragraph featuresï¼š[https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hiarsl/feature-engineering-sentence-paragraph-features)

Notice: This is a short two-week project.
## Project Introdution:
**Data Set**: Essays and Typing Behavior Logs (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/data). 

**Overview of the Dataset**: 
The dataset encompasses a comprehensive collection of essays paired with detailed keystroke logs. These logs capture the intricate process of essay writing, including every keystroke and editing action taken by the writers. The dataset's uniqueness lies in its dual focus: the final essay and the journey taken to create it.

**Data Structure**:
**Training Set**:
The training set provides a subset of essays and their corresponding keystroke logs. This set is designed to help participants understand the relationship between writing processes and essay quality. It includes a variety of writing styles and approaches, encapsulating the diversity of the writing process.

**Test Set**:
The test set, used for final evaluation, remains undisclosed during the competition. It contains a new set of essays and keystroke logs, challenging participants to apply their models to unseen data. The test set is key in determining how well models generalize beyond the training data.

**Stakeholders:** Minzhi Huang, RunTian Li, Salva Umar, Yimei Yang.
